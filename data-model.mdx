## IR Procedure Classification Framework

### Rules Document for Implementation

---

## I. OVERVIEW

**Purpose**: Systematically categorize interventional radiology procedures for cost analysis, utilization review, and physician practice pattern analysis.

**Data Structure**: One row per CPT code; multiple CPT codes can map to the same claim/case

- Primary classification source: CPT codes
- Secondary source: Primary_procedure field (if CPT invalid/missing)
- ICD-10 codes: Reserved for future embolization subtype refinement

**Output Fields**:

- `procedure_category` (9 possible values)
- `procedure_subtype` (specific to each category)
- `classification_confidence` (High/Medium/Low)
- `manual_review_flag` (Yes/No)

## III. CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM

### Step 1: Data Preparation

For each **claim** (group of rows with same claim ID):

1. Collect all CPT codes associated with the claim
2. Collect primary_procedure field value
3. Collect all ICD-10 codes (for future use)

### Step 2: CPT Code Validation

For each CPT code in the claim:

1. Check if CPT code is in the master mapping (Sections II.1-II.9)
2. If **valid**: Proceed to Step 3
3. If **invalid/unrecognized**: Flag and proceed to Step 4

### Step 3: Procedure Hierarchy Application

Apply the **procedure hierarchy** to determine primary classification:

**Hierarchy (Highest → Lowest Priority)**:

1. Oncologic Interventions
2. Arterial Interventions
3. Embolization
4. Venous Interventions
5. Venous Access
6. Image-Guided Drainage
7. Image-Guided Biopsy
8. Enteric Access
9. Diagnostic/Other

**Rules**:

- Identify ALL categories present in the claim's CPT codes
- Assign the claim to the **highest priority category** found
- Within that category, assign to the **most specific subtype** based on CPT codes present
- If multiple subtypes within same category, assign to **first subtype identified** in CPT code order

**Example**:

- Claim has CPT: 75710 (peripheral angiography) + 37224 (femoral angioplasty)
- Categories found: Diagnostic/Other (#9) + Arterial Interventions (#2)
- **Assigned**: Arterial Interventions → Angioplasty/Stenting (hierarchy priority #2 \> #9)

### Step 4: Primary_Procedure Fallback

If **no valid CPT codes** found OR **all CPT codes invalid**:

1. Use primary_procedure field for classification
2. Apply text matching rules:

```
Primary_Procedure Text → Category Assignment:

"VASCULAR ACCESS" → Venous Access (subtype: unable to determine from text)
"PARACENTESIS" → Image-Guided Drainage → Paracentesis
"BIOPSY" → Image-Guided Biopsy (subtype: unable to determine from text)
"NEPHROSTOMY" → Image-Guided Drainage → Nephrostomy/Exchange
"ANGIOGRAM" → Diagnostic/Other → Peripheral or Visceral Angiography
"EMBOLIZATION" → Embolization (subtype: Other Embolization)
"DRAINAGE" → Image-Guided Drainage → Abscess/Fluid Drainage
"FEEDING TUBE" or "G-TUBE" or "GJ-TUBE" → Enteric Access (subtype based on text)
"LUMBAR PUNCTURE" → Diagnostic/Other → Neuraxial/Lumbar Puncture
"THORACENTESIS" → Image-Guided Drainage → Thoracentesis

Unrecognized text → Category: Unclassified, Subtype: Unclassified
```

### Step 5: Classification Confidence Assignment

**High Confidence**:

- Valid CPT code(s) found
- Category and subtype clearly identified from CPT codes
- No conflicting codes present

**Medium Confidence**:

- Valid CPT code(s) found BUT subtype requires ICD-10 refinement (e.g., embolization subtypes)
- Multiple therapeutic procedures in same claim (hierarchy applied but clinical judgment may differ)
- Primary_procedure text used with clear match to category

**Low Confidence**:

- No valid CPT codes found AND primary_procedure text is ambiguous
- Primary_procedure text used with unclear/partial match
- CPT code valid but rare/uncommon code not well-documented in mapping

### Step 6: Manual Review Flag

**Flag = "Yes"** if any of the following:

- Classification confidence = "Low"
- Category = "Unclassified"
- Subtype = "Other" within any category
- Multiple high-priority therapeutic procedures in same claim (e.g., arterial intervention + embolization + ablation)
- Embolization category assigned (requires ICD-10 review for subtype - see Section IV)
- Oncologic Interventions category assigned (requires ICD-10 review for subtype - see Section IV)

**Flag = "No"** otherwise

---

## IV. ICD-10 REFINEMENT RULES (TO BE DEVELOPED)

**Purpose**: Use ICD-10 codes to refine subtype classification for ambiguous CPT codes, particularly:

- Embolization subtypes (UFE vs Y90 vs TACE vs Hemorrhage/Trauma)
- Oncologic intervention subtypes (distinguishing Y90 from TACE when both use CPT 37243)

**Status**: TO BE DEVELOPED in collaboration with clinical team

**Initial Framework**:

### Embolization Subtype Refinement:

```
IF CPT = 37243 (embolization for tumor):
  - AND ICD-10 = D25.x (uterine leiomyoma) → UFE
  - AND ICD-10 = C22.x (liver cancer) + no chemo codes → Y90 (probable)
  - AND ICD-10 = C22.x (liver cancer) + chemo codes (96420-96423) → TACE
  - AND ICD-10 = other cancer codes → Tumor Embolization (bland)

IF CPT = 37244 (hemorrhage/lymphatic):
  → Hemorrhage/Trauma (confirmed)

IF CPT = 37241 or 37242:
  - AND ICD-10 = I86.1 (varicocele) → Varicocele
  - AND ICD-10 = S00-T88 (trauma codes) → Hemorrhage/Trauma
  - Otherwise → Other Embolization
```

### Oncologic Subtype Refinement:

```
IF thermal ablation CPT codes present → Thermal Ablation (confirmed)

IF CPT = 37243 + liver cancer ICD-10:
  - AND CPT includes 96420-96423 (chemo) → TACE
  - AND CPT includes 79445 (radiopharmaceutical) → Y90
  - AND no chemo/radiopharm codes → Tumor Embolization (bland)
  
Requires manual review if unable to distinguish Y90 from TACE
```

**Action Item**: Develop comprehensive ICD-10 mapping after initial CPT-based classification is validated.

1. `claim_id` - Original claim identifier
2. `procedure_category` - One of 9 categories (or "Unclassified")
3. `procedure_subtype` - Specific subtype within category (or "Unclassified")
4. `classification_confidence` - "High", "Medium", or "Low"
5. `manual_review_flag` - "Yes" or "No"

**Optional Output Fields** (recommended for validation): 6. `cpt_codes_used` - List of CPT codes found in claim 7. `primary_cpt_used` - Primary CPT code that determined classification 8. `classification_source` - "CPT" or "Primary_Procedure" 9. `hierarchy_priority` - Numeric priority (1-9) of assigned category

## VII. VALIDATION & QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Initial Validation Steps:

1. **Run classification on full dataset** (5,000 cases)
2. **Generate summary statistics**:
   - Count by procedure_category
   - Count by procedure_subtype within each category
   - Count by classification_confidence
   - Count by manual_review_flag
3. **Compare to primary_procedure field**:
   - Cross-tabulation of primary_procedure vs procedure_category
   - Identify major discrepancies
4. **Manual review sample**:
   - Review 10-20 cases per category
   - Focus on "Medium" and "Low" confidence cases
   - Validate hierarchy application for multi-procedure claims

### Ongoing Quality Checks:

- Monitor "Unclassified" rate (target: \<5%)
- Monitor "Manual Review" flag rate (target: \<20%)
- Review new/uncommon CPT codes quarterly
- Update master mapping as new procedures introduced

## VIII. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

1. **ICD-10 Integration**: Develop comprehensive embolization and oncologic subtype refinement rules
2. **Physician Validation**: Use IR physician list to validate procedure classifications
3. **Supply Cost Integration**: Link procedure categories to supply cost data for spend analysis
4. **Practice Pattern Analysis**: Build physician-level dashboards showing procedure mix and variation
5. **Automated Alerts**: Flag unusual procedure combinations or coding patterns for compliance review
